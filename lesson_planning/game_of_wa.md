This game was conceived by a student of mine.

The goal of the game is to ask a open ended question toÂ  the whole group in hopes that everyone will come up with the same answer.

What is a big fish in the sea?

Give everyone time to think of an answer.

Then you count down 3, 2, 1. Tuna.

Everyone says their own answers, but your hoping everyone will say the same answer. If an answer is really different you can discuss why they thought of that answer.
