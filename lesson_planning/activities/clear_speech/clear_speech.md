This activities has students listen and compare different sounds.

The most famous one being the L and R sound.

The alt provides a handout with different sounding words on it. The alt explains the differences in the two sounds.

1. light - right
2. led - red
3. alive - arrive

The activity has the ALT read one of the words being compared.

"number one right, right, the door to your right."

I like to include an example sentence for students to listen to the word in context.
