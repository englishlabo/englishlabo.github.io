This page will include different activities to use in the classroom.

A tip for using activities is to adjust the activity to your students level. You can make an activity easier by adding more information for students or make it more difficult by leaving things out. For example having an past tense actvity where students are given the model sentence "I watched TV yesterday."

Have them practice watched by making the sentences first. After that have them make their own sentences with the verb only. If thats to easy give them the present tense and have them change it themselves.
