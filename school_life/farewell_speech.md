Hello everyone, 

I’ve really enjoyed working at 
____ High School for the past 5 years. 

I feel very lucky to have the chance to meet all of you. 

You have all been very helpful and I’ve learned a lot. 

My time at this school has been very interesting and 
full of wonderful experiences. 

I would like to thank Kocho Sensei, 
Kyotō Sensei and all the teachers for their kindness. 

I would especially like to thank ____ sensei for everything. 

Finally, to all the students, 
it is because of you that I have had such an amazing time in ____ High School. 

Thank you very much.
