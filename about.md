## The Mission ##

The reason I decided to create this website is because I spent 5 years improving my ideas for teaching English in a Japanese classroom. I never came from a English or teaching background I felt a related to many people who decide to teach English abroad. I felt like there was a lack of organization for people in this situation. By sharing my experience I'm hoping that assistant language teachers get up to speed and create a great learning environment for their students.


## Goals ##

During my time as an ALT I learned alot from other teachers and ideally I would like to create an organized space for other ALTs to contribute, share and recieve credit for their contributions as an ALT.
